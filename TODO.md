* TEST is it possible to copy scripts to HDD once filesystem is created?
* TEST is it also possible to copy scripts to the new filesystem after pacstrap, before chrooting?
* TEST is there any reason to switch to user performing the install? can I avoid a seperate script by staying as root?
* TEST add gdebi package
* TEST script 2 now has a systemctl start sshd, which hopefully works....
* TEST as of last, script 2 was finished, write new script 3 once you figure out how to make 4 available to user.
* start over once 3 is tested???
* reup git, and start vm with new download
